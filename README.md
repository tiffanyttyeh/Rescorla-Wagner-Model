## Rescorla-Wagner-Model
The key assumptions of the Rescorla-Wagner model are:

- Learning occurs through prediction errors (the difference between expected and actual outcomes).
-  The associative strength (expectation of the outcome) is updated incrementally after each trial.
- The learning rate determines the speed of updating the associative strength.

## Limitations
The Rescorla-Wagner model assumes a single stimulus and outcome. In reality, social media behavior is more complex - users may learn associations for different types of posts, and likes may not be the only relevant outcome (e.g., comments, shares).
The model assumes a linear relationship between the prediction error and the update to the associative strength. This may not hold for social media behavior - for example, there may be diminishing returns to increasing likes beyond a certain point.
The model doesn't account for other factors that may influence posting behavior, such as a user's intrinsic motivation to share content or their social relationships with other users.
The learning rate in the classical Rescorla-Wagner model is constant. In the social media context, it may make more sense for the learning rate to vary over time or across individuals.
